Notes: Created an initial version that logs to Mongo. This includes all relevant source code fields and the stack trace. 
Log4J can be enabled in the MLogger, but is optional. Indexes are automatically created in Mongo db "log" for 
all the collections that are created. The name of the collection can be chosen by the user, and starts with the
level name such as INFOlog, DEBUGlog. The default collection is "log". But user can choose collection name at
each log statement.
